  abstract = {This paper investigates the influence of metro accessibility on Xi'an residential property values. The key finding is that proximity to metro stations tends to have a positive but nonlinear effect. Within two-kilometre road network distances from metro stations, property value uplift is lowest in areas immediately adjacent to metro stations, explained by negative externalities around metro stations outweighing accessibility gains. The highest effect is revealed at distances between 300 and 1200 metres away from stations. Other significant influences include the distance to the central business district, the size of the property, the age of the property, interior decoration, residential building type and geographical location. The evidence suggests that the catchment area size should be adjusted according to access mode shares. Policy implications are also provided for potential future decision making.}

  abstract  = {The construction of subways has an external impact on the urban environment. Among them, the most important acceleration function lies in the property values of housing near subway stations. Tianjin, the largest open coastal city in Northern China, is selected as the subject of the research in this paper by virtue of its unique background. The Hedonic Pricing Model is used in analysing the change in the value of the properties located within 1,000 metres of completed subway line 3 stations. Using the theories of land rent and land location, and a model of the impact of urban traffic on the surrounding real estate prices, we analyse the sphere of influence of Tianjin Metro Line 3 on real estate prices. Finally, the paper stresses the importance of urban construction and subway building and finds that different development strategies should be used according to the characteristics of the subway in various regions of the city.}
